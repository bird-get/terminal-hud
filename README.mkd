Terminal HUD is a powerful virtual terminal inside Second Life.
It's made for advanced users who know their way around a CLI.

It is kind of hacked together and something I work on for fun in my spare time.

It listens for chat commands, parses the input and then displays its output
using prim media.

## Features
- colorized output
- autocompletion

programs:
- inventory packer
- object rezzer
- particle generator
- get information about avatars, objects, attachments and sims

## Quick start

## How to use
You can get a ready-to-use copy from [my SL Marketplace store](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/stores/63546). It contains useful objects in its inventory.
If you would rather make your own HUD, follow the steps in the next section.

Attach the HUD to a HUD slot. Position it using the SL build tools or by
clicking and dragging the top bar.

Type commands on channel 42. For example, `/42 avlist -s -r` will
show a list of all avatars in the current region, along with their script
and render information.

For more help about functions, type `/42 help`.

## Making add-ons
You can create your own add-on programs.
Create a script and call it `[name].lslp` (i.e. `partgen.lslp`).
Put it into the HUD. You can use your add-on like any other program in the HUD.

## Creating your own HUD
*Note: The LSL preprocessor is required to compile these scripts.*

1. Clone the repo.
2. Add the cloned repo to Firestorm's LSL preprocessor include path.

    I personally put the repo at `~/firestorm-preprocessor/terminal-hud/`
    and use `~/firestorm-preprocessor` as the preprocessor include path.
3. Create three scripts, call them `interpreter.lsl`, `display.lsl` and `creator.lsl`.
4. Copy the contents of the scripts in the repo to their respective script in SL.
5. Rez two cubes and link them together.
6. Place the three scripts into the object's inventory.
7. Attach the object to a HUD slot, and use as said in the previous chapter.
