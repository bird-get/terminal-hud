# Terminal HUD
![Terminal HUD](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33850042/33088552-352bc11e-ceee-11e7-9a7a-1961bd6dd097.png "HUD")

Terminal HUD is a virtual terminal inside Second Life.
It listens for chat commands, parses the input and then displays its output
using prim media.

## How to use
You can get a ready-to-use copy from [my SL Marketplace store](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/stores/63546).  
If you would rather make your own HUD, follow the steps in the next chapter.

Attach the HUD to a HUD slot and position it using the SL build tools.

Type commands on channel 42. For example, `/42 avlist -s -r` will
show a list of all avatars in the current region, along with their script
and render information.

For more help about functions, type `/42 help`.

## Creating your own HUD
*Note: LSL preprocessor is required for includes*

1. Clone the repo.
2. Add the cloned repo to Firestorm's LSL preprocessor include path.

    I personally put the repo at `~/firestorm-preprocessor/terminal-hud/`
    and use `~/firestorm-preprocessor` as the preprocessor include path.
3. Create three scripts, call them `interpreter.lsl`, `display.lsl` and `creator.lsl`.
4. Copy the contents of the scripts in the repo to their respective script in SL.
5. Rez two cubes and link them together.
6. Place the three scripts into the object's inventory.
7. Attach the object to a HUD slot, and use as said in the previous chapter.

## Motivation
I switched to Linux a while ago, and fell in love with the command line due to
the speed advantages. I looked for a command line tool for Second Life, but
could not find one, so I decided to make my own.
