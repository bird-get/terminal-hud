        - [ ] get: fix 'get all' returning cut off results
        - [x] fix: only single digit values are handled
        - [ ] export: give functionality
        - [ ] command: import (takes LSL func, parses to effect)

        - [ ] Set a reasonable memory limit

    - [ ] Add customizable MOTD (read from notecard, maybe?)
    - [ ] Make avattached name column wider
    - [ ] Finetune HUD default size (make text size more accurate)
    - [x] Only unblock very important functions (like reset) when program is running
